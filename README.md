# poopabot
This is a collaborative project set to design a poop scooping robot.
The components of the project will be as follows:

Basic Arduino controlled 4 wheeled robot.
Capability to identify poo using something like a CNG sensor.
Ability to scoop the poop and put it somewhere useful.
Area location as an example extension to identify which area has been covered and which areas still to do.
Maybe an updated poop map setting location and frequency.
Use the location and frequency to build a targeting intelligence.
